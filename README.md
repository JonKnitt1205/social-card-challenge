## My process
### What I learned

I used css variables for repeating use of certain colors, added hover and active effects, and learned to style a link to look more like a button.

### Continued development

This is my second challenge and I am starting to get faster and more confident with simple HTML/CSS. Google and StackOverflow were used significantly less this time around. I hope to continue on some of these easier challenges so that I feel prepared moving onto harder ones.
